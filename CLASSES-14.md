This video explains access modifiers in C++ classes within the context of inheritance. Access modifiers (public, private, protected) control the visibility and accessibility of class members.

**Public:** Members declared as public are accessible from anywhere - inside the class, from derived classes, and from outside the class.
**Private:** Members declared as private are only accessible from within the class itself. Derived classes or external code cannot access them directly.
**Protected:** Members declared as protected are accessible within the class itself and also by its derived classes. They are not accessible from outside the class hierarchy.

### Key Concepts:

**Default Access**: In C++, struct members are public by default, while class members are private by default. This is the only distinction between struct and class in terms of default access.

**Inheritance and Access:** The video uses an example with a Base class and a Derived class (which inherits from Base) to illustrate access levels:

**Base Class:** Contains public, protected, and private member variables.
**Derived Class (Public Inheritance):** Inherits publicly from the Base class (class Derived : public Base).
Member Accessibility:

**Inside Derived Class:**

Public members of Base are accessible.
Protected members of Base are accessible.
Private members of Base are not accessible.
Outside Classes (e.g., main() function):

Public members of Derived (and publicly inherited members from Base) are accessible.
Protected members of Derived or Base are not accessible.
Private members of Derived or Base are not accessible.
Inheritance Access Specifiers: C++ offers different types of inheritance that modify the access levels of inherited members in the derived class:

Public Inheritance (class Derived : public Base):  The access levels of public and protected members of the Base class are preserved in the Derived class. This is the most common and intuitive type of inheritance.

Protected Inheritance (class Derived : protected Base):  Both public and protected members of the Base class become protected members in the Derived class. This limits external access further.

Private Inheritance (class Derived : private Base): Both public and protected members of the Base class become private members in the Derived class. This is the most restrictive form, effectively hiding the base class's interface from external users of the derived class.

**Practical Guidelines:**
Public Inheritance: Use this most frequently when you want to model an "is-a" relationship (e.g., a Dog is a Animal).
Protected Inheritance: Consider this when the base class serves as an internal interface, and you need to limit external access to base class members while allowing derived classes to use them.
Private Inheritance: This is the most restrictive and less common. It's used when you want to implement a "has-a" relationship or when you want to reuse the implementation of the base class without exposing its public interface.
Best Practices:

Encapsulation: Be conservative and use the most restrictive access level possible (prefer private or protected over public) to encapsulate implementation details and prevent unintended external modifications.
Coding Standards: Adhere to company-specific or project-specific coding guidelines regarding the use of access modifiers to maintain consistency and readability.
Code Examples
The video refers to a Stack Overflow post for code examples illustrating these concepts.  While the exact code isn't directly provided in the video transcript, the video refers to a table from a Stack Overflow post.  You can find numerous C++ code examples demonstrating public, private, and protected inheritance online by searching for "C++ inheritance access levels examples".

For example, a basic code example demonstrating public, protected, and private access within base and derived classes would look like this:

C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base {
public:
    int publicVar;
protected:
    int protectedVar;
private:
    int privateVar;

public:
    Base() : publicVar(1), protectedVar(2), privateVar(3) {}

    void printBase() {
        std::cout << "Base Public: " << publicVar << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Base Protected: " << protectedVar << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Base Private: " << privateVar << std::endl; // Accessible in Base
    }
};

class DerivedPublic : public Base {
public:
    void printDerivedPublic() {
        std::cout << "Derived Public - Base Public: " << publicVar << std::endl;      // Accessible
        std::cout << "Derived Public - Base Protected: " << protectedVar << std::endl; // Accessible
        // std::cout << "Derived Public - Base Private: " << privateVar << std::endl; // Not Accessible - Compile Error
    }
};

class DerivedProtected : protected Base {
public:
    void printDerivedProtected() {
        std::cout << "Derived Protected - Base Public: " << publicVar << std::endl;      // Accessible, now protected in DerivedProtected
        std::cout << "Derived Protected - Base Protected: " << protectedVar << std::endl; // Accessible
        // std::cout << "Derived Protected - Base Private: " << privateVar << std::endl; // Not Accessible - Compile Error
    }
};

class DerivedPrivate : private Base {
public:
    void printDerivedPrivate() {
        std::cout << "Derived Private - Base Public: " << publicVar << std::endl;      // Accessible, now private in DerivedPrivate
        std::cout << "Derived Private - Base Protected: " << protectedVar << std::endl; // Accessible
        // std::cout << "Derived Private - Base Private: " << privateVar << std::endl; // Not Accessible - Compile Error
    }
};


int main() {
    Base baseObj;
    DerivedPublic pubObj;
    DerivedProtected protObj;
    DerivedPrivate privObj;


    std::cout << "Base Class Output:" << std::endl;
    baseObj.printBase();
    std::cout << "Publicly Derived Class Output:" << std::endl;
    pubObj.printDerivedPublic();


    std::cout << "Accessing from outside:" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Base Public (from Base): " << baseObj.publicVar << std::endl;         // Accessible
    std::cout << "Public Derived Public (from DerivedPublic): " << pubObj.publicVar << std::endl; // Accessible

    // std::cout << "Base Protected (from Base): " << baseObj.protectedVar << std::endl;   // Not Accessible - Compile Error
    // std::cout << "Public Derived Protected (from DerivedPublic): " << pubObj.protectedVar << std::endl; // Not Accessible - Compile Error
    // std::cout << "Base Private (from Base): " << baseObj.privateVar << std::endl;     // Not Accessible - Compile Error
    // std::cout << "Public Derived Private (from DerivedPublic): " << pubObj.privateVar << std::endl;   // Not Accessible - Compile Error


    return 0;
}
```
This code illustrates the different access levels and how they behave in inheritance. Remember to compile and run this code with a C++ compiler to observe the output and access restrictions.
